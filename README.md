## Date: 20/11/2025
## Reg. No: 212223060261
## Aim:
To explore and understand the various prompting techniques used for generating videos using AI models.

## Algorithm
1.Familiarize yourself with video generation models.
2.Create simple prompts for video generation.
3.Experiment with detailed prompts.
4.Add time and motion elements.
5.Test different video styles.
6.Iterate and adjust prompts.
7.Generate multiple versions.
8.Save and compare outputs.

# Procedure
### 1. Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models
Explore AI tools capable of generating videos from text prompts:

1.Runway Gen-2
2.Synthesia
3.Pictory
4.DeepBrain AI
Understand their capabilities, limitations, output duration, style options, and supported features before starting.

### 2. Create Simple Prompts for Video Generation
Begin with basic prompts to observe how AI interprets simple actions.
#### Example prompt:
```
A girl playing badminton in kimono outfit.
```
#### Output video:

### 3. Experiment with More Detailed Prompts
Gradually increase the complexity by adding environmental details and actions.

#### Example Prompt:
```
A girl playing badminton in sports outfit in a badminton court.
```
#### Output video:

### 4. Add Time and Motion Elements
Include elements such as transitions, time-lapse, or camera movement.

#### Example Prompt:
```
A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the mountains, with the camera slowly
zooming out from the desert, capturing the sand and changing sky colors.
```

#### Output video:

### 5. Test Different Video Styles
Experiment with different genres such as animated, cinematic, artistic, or futuristic.

#### Example Prompt:
```
An animated scene of a japanese city at night, with lights,
flying trains, and a bustling crowd.
```

#### Output video:
